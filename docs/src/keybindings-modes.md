# Modes
The keybindings are divided into several modes. Each mode has its separate keybindings.

eg.
```kdl
keybinds {
    normal {
        // keybindings available in normal mode
    }
    pane {
        // keybindings available in pane mode
    }
}
```

The available modes are:
- normal

- move
- tab
- scroll
- search
- entersearch
- renametab
