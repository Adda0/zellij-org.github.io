# Status of the Plugin System
While even at this early stage, the Zellij plugin system offers powerful capabilities to plugin developers and users alike, there are a few key missing features that are all currently being addressed. This page lists the major ones:

1. [Permission system for plugins](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/1395)
2. [Plugin backwards compatibility](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2555)
3. [Filesystem access is not very fast](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2556)
4. [Plugins cannot be loaded from the web and so their distribution is not trivial](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/1393)
5. [Plugins cannot communicate with each other](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2557)
6. [Plugin commands are asynchronous and provide no success/failure indication](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2558)
7. [More plugin APIs](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2559)
