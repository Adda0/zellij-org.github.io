# The tab-bar Alias

This alias, by default translated to the internal `zellij:tab-bar` plugin url, represents the tab bar loaded on the top line of the default layout.

## Contract
Zellij loads this tab bar with a height of `1` and a width the size of the user's full screen. Zellij has no other expectations from this plugin, even though users will probably expect at least the tabs to be shown.
