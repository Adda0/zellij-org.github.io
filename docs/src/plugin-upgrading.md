# Upgrading a Plugin

Zellij plugins are backwards compatible - meaning that a plugin compiled for an older version of Zellij should always run fine on a newer version of Zellij.

The plugin API however might break every now and then for plugin *code* that has not been compiled for the current version. We try to minimize these occurrences as much as possible.
