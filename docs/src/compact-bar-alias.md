# The compact-bar alias

This alias, by default translated to the internal `zellij:compact-bar` plugin url, represents the compact-bar loaded in the compact layout on the bottom of the screen.

## Contract
Zellij loads this compact bar with a height of `1` and a width the size of the user's full screen. Zellij has no other expectations from this plugin, even though users will probably expect at least the input mode and the tabs be shown.
