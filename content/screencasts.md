[{{<figure src="/img/tutorial-1-preview.png" class="center" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/basic-functionality)
Here we demonstrate some of the more basic functionality of Zellij and terminal multiplexers in general.

We'll show how to open multiple terminal tiled and floating panes.

Instead of retyping a command or searching through our shell history, we'll see how we can use Command Panes to keep frequently run commands around.
Finally, we'll talk about editing a pane's scrollback with our own `$EDITOR`

### [Layouts](/tutorials/layouts)

This tutorial walks you through creating Zellij [layouts](/documentation/creating-a-layout.html) to automate tasks and workflows.

Layouts describe a pre-defined set of panes and tabs with different terminals, commands and plugins. They can be great to automate and formalize workflows and tasks.
