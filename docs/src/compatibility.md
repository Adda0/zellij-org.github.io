# Known Issues

## The status bar fonts don't render correctly:

This most likely is caused by a missing character in the font.

Fonts from [nerdfonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) can fix this problem.


Some Options:

| Package Manager   |      Name      |
|-------------------|:--------------:|
