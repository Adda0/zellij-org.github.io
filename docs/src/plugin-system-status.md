# Status of the Plugin System
While even at this early stage, the Zellij plugin system offers powerful capabilities to plugin developers and users alike, there are a few key missing features that are all currently being addressed. This page lists the major ones:

1. Permission system for plugins (TODO: link to issue)
2. Plugin backwards compatibility (TODO: link to issue)
3. Filesystem access is not very fast (TODO: link to issue)
4. Plugins cannot be loaded from the web (TODO: link to issue)
5. Plugins cannot communicate with each other (TODO: link to issue)
6. Plugins should know more about the application state (TODO: link to issue)
7. Plugin commands are asynchronous and provide no success/failure indication (TODO: link to issue)
8. Plugin distribution is not trivial (TODO: link to issue)
