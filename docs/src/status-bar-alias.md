# The status-bar alias

This alias, by default translated to the internal `zellij:status-bar` plugin url, represents the status-bar loaded in the default layout on the bottom of the screen.

## Contract
Zellij loads this status bar with a height of `2` and a width the size of the user's full screen. Zellij has no other expectations from this plugin, even though users will probably expect at least the input modes and their status be shown.
