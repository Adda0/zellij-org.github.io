### [Basic Functionality + Floating Panes + Command Panes + Scrollback Editing](/tutorials/basic-functionality)
[{{<figure src="/img/tutorial-1-preview.png" class="center" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/basic-functionality)
Here we demonstrate some of the more basic functionality of Zellij and terminal multiplexers in general.

We'll show how to open multiple terminal tiled and floating panes.

Instead of retyping a command or searching through our shell history, we'll see how we can use Command Panes to keep frequently run commands around.
Finally, we'll talk about editing a pane's scrollback with our own `$EDITOR`
